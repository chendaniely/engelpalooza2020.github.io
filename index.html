    <h2>What is Engelpalooza?</h2>
    <p align="justify">
        Engelpalooza is a research showcase hosted by the Virginia Tech Department of Biochemistry. 
        This event allows undergraduate and graduate researchers to showcase the work they have done and for those seeking research opportunities to see the various ways they can get involved.
    </p>
    <p>
        Engelpalooza 2020 will be held as a virtual poster symposium on the communication platform, Discord.

    <h2>New to Discord?</h2>
    <p>
        Discord is a messaging service that is intended to serve as a networking and meeting place for Engelpalooza 2020 attendees to communicate, discuss and share their work, and sync up with conference events.
        The following instructions were adapted from <a>https://bcc2020.github.io/</a>
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Getting Discord:</b>
    </p>
    <ul>
    <li>Discord in your browser: <a>https://discord.com/app</a></li>
    <li>Discord on your desktop <a>https://discord.com/new/download</a></li>
    <li>Discord on your mobile device</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        We recommend using the Discord application on your desktop instead of the browser version, but either should work fine. 
        Please avoid using the mobile version unless absolutely necessary.
    </p>
    <p><b> Logging in: </b></p>
    <p> When you follow the invitation link above, you will be invited to join the group with a page that prompts you for a username. 
        Choose a username to log in. Alternatively if youâ€™ve used Discord before, you can log in using that username and password. 
        Once logged in, it will prompt you for your birthday in order to verify your age is over 13, and then request your email address and password in order to create an account.</p>
    <p><b> Quick Overview: </b></p>  
    <p> Once you have access to the server, you will see the list of categories and channels on the left side of the screen, the chat window in the center, and the member list on the right.
        <b>Channel:</b> a chat window. Can be either text or voice, but usually text. Shown on the left side in the channel list preceded with #.
        <b>Category:</b> Grouping of channels. Shows on the left side in the channel list as an all caps heading.
        <b>Channel list:</b> the complete list of channels and categories, shown on the left side of the desktop app.
        <b>Member list:<b/> the listing of members/attendees in the current channel, shown on the right side of the desktop app
