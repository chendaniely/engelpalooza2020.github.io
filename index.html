    <h2>What is Engelpalooza?</h2>
    <p align="justify">
        Engelpalooza is a research showcase hosted by the Virginia Tech Department of Biochemistry. 
        Engelpalooza offers undergraduate and graduate students involved in biochemistry and research a unique forum to showcase their research, exchange ideas, and improve their communication skills, all while networking with members of the Virginia Tech scientific community. 
        This event also allows undergraduate seeking research opportunities to see the various ways they can get involved.
        This event is sponsored by Virginia Tech's Biochemistry Department, and made possible by the Howard Hughes Medical Institute Inclusive Excellence initiative.
    </p>
    <p>
        Engelpalooza 2020 will be held as a virtual poster symposium on the communication platform, Discord.
