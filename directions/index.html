    <h2>Code of Conduct</h2>
    <p>The Biochemistry Department is dedicated to keeping a safe environment for all participants to partake in the virtual poster symposium without fear of harassment or discriminatory behavior. All participants are expected to follow the Code of Conduct, listed below. If an incident occurs, we ask that participants report via the Conduct Violation Google Form (see Enforcement and Reporting), which will be monitored by the event organizers throughout the symposium. </p>
    <p><b>Unacceptable Behavior</b></p>
    <p>Any behavior that is can be considered a threat, harassment, or discrimination is strictly prohibited. This includes any behavior that produces an unsafe environment for participants. Offensive verbal and non-verbal comments and expressions related to gender, gender identity, gender expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, religious or political beliefs; sexual or discriminatory images in online spaces; deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography, screenshots or recording; sustained disruption of talks or other events, and unwelcome sexual attention will result in an immediate ban and will be reported accordingly. Comments and expressions that are explicitly racist, sexist, homophobic, etc. their gender, race, or religion and deliberately attempting to make others feel bad, name-calling, singling out others for derision or exclusion will result in an immediate ban and will be reported to Student Affairs.</p>
    <p><b>Enforcement and Reporting </b></p>
    <p>Any reports of violation of the Code of Conducts above will result in immediate removal from the meeting for the duration of the symposium. You will be blocked from returning to any of the sessions that happen throughout the symposium and will be removed from the Discord server.</p>
